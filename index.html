          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
            <li>Must first declare a variable using "let" variable = x. Then can change later saying variable = x</li>
            <li>Variables can be Strings (text sequence in quotes), Numbers (no quotes), Boolean (true/false) arrays (in brackets separated by commas) or Objects (anything)</li>
            <li>Can write comments using "/* comment */" "// comment" which will be ignored by browser but there for your reference</li>
            <li>A (+) adds 2 numbers or concatenates strings. (-) for subtraction. (*) for multiplication. (/) for division</li>
            <li>An "=" assigns a variable. "===" is strict equality and tests if two items are the same and same data type returned as true/false</li>
            <li>To denote not use (!). To note does not equal use (!==)</li>
            <li>Conditionals are "if...else" statements</li>
            <li>The parenthases following a function contains arguments, separated by commas if muliple. These are inputs.</li>
            <li>Events are activity from the user that a website listens for in order to employ some sort of action (addEventListener("event", () {result}))</li>
            <li>Adding "const" prior to a variable means it cannot be reassigned and remains constant value. Adding "let" means it can be changed later</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS reads top to bottom and left to right</li>
            <li>Control flow can be interrupted by conditional statements (if, else if, else) or by loops (for or while)</li>
            <li>An array stores a group of related data within brackets. Each variable counts up item [0], item [1], item [2], etc</li>
            <li>First define an array: const var = [item1, item2, item3, etc]. To iterate over a loop: for(let x = 0; x < var.length; x++)</li>
