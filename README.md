# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description


This is a Prework Study Guide webpage which was designed to help bootcamp students review their notes in an organized fashion. It contains information on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript topics. From this project, I learned how to build a basic webpage and add code using these tools to give it content, style and functionality.
